Logistic Regression README
This repository contains a simple implementation of logistic regression using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The logistic regression model is trained on synthetic data generated with a binary classification task.

File Structure
logistic_regression.py: Python script containing the implementation of logistic regression.
README.md: This file providing information and instructions.
requirements.txt: List of Python packages required for running the script.
Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the required Python packages installed by running the following command:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Logistic Regression Model
To run the logistic regression model, execute the following command:


python logistic_regression.py
This will generate a scatter plot of the synthetic data points and the decision boundary learned by the logistic regression model.

Implementation Details
sigmoid Function
The sigmoid function implements the sigmoid activation function, which is used to transform raw model outputs into probabilities.

logistic_regression Function
The logistic_regression function performs logistic regression training using gradient descent. It takes input features X and labels y, and iteratively updates the model parameters to minimize the logistic loss. The default learning rate is set to 0.01, and the number of iterations is set to 1000.

Synthetic Data Generation
The synthetic data is generated using NumPy. The input features X are random values, and the labels y are generated based on whether each value in X is greater than 1.

Results
The script produces a scatter plot of the synthetic data points and overlays the learned decision boundary. The decision boundary is represented by the red line on the plot.
